the command line is a way of interacting with the computer using text instructions, instead of mouse input and pictures

All commands work within your current folder

cd: changes the folder you're working in
pwd: tells you the full address of your folder
ls: lists the contents
mkdir X: creates a new folder/directory called X
rmdir: removes a folder 
touch X: creates a new, empty file, named X
rm: removes a file
cp X Y: copies file X, names the copy Y
mv: moves a file. If the file is moved from a directory to itself, it renames the file instead
exit: quit the terminal
